For Wiring and to Make it Work:

Hardware Requirement : - 
    ESP32 dev Module (34 gpio Variant)
    Jumper Wires
    BreadBaord(Optional but recommended)
    MPU-6050 Sensor (for accelerator and gyro sensing)


Connections :-
    MPU-6050:
        VCC -> ESP32 3.3V
        GND -> ESP32 GND
        SCL -> P26
        SDA -> P33

Changes In the Arundio Code File 
    Put your Wifi SSid and Password . Make Sure you use 2.4 Ghz wifi as esp32 only support 2.4 ghz wifi .
    Next check your PC/Laptop Ip address using ipconfig in cmd . (ipV4)
    Put in esp32Code on line const char* udpAddress = "192.168.0.197"; (Update as per your Ip Address).

Now Simply Install the Requirement Libraries and Turn on the Hardware and Open the Python File
